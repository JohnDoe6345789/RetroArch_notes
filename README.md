# RetroArch_notes
Doing RetroArch hacking and trying to document here - this will take me some time to figure out. I don't like how hard it is to use out the box. I will start by improving it on x68_64 + Windows.

1. Install RetroArch on Steam (best idea as it autoupdates and includes Steam overlay and Steam input improvements)
